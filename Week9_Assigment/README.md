Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

> Objective:  stand up a basic honeypot and demonstrate its effectiveness at detecting and/or collecting data about an attack



## Writeup:
### Deployed honeypots:
	Dionaea
	Cowrie
### Issues encountered:
	I had probems running the script on Cowrie Honeypot, I ran the sript multiple time but the same error occured, I coundl't resolve this problem. As result, the admin honeypot could not listen attacks from Cowrie honeypot.

### Summary of the data collected: 
	I set up the honeypot follow the instructions in the assigment by Codepath. My target honeypot is running at the IP:104.155.174.180 . After set up the honeypot I ran the command nmap 104.155.174.180 on a separate terminal. Once it finished running I open the MHN admin website and over a thoundsand attacks. I noticed that most of the attacks came from my local host, however there were a lot of attacks came from different ip address and out of the country. There was no maculous attacks.
